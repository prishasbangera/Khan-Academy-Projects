                Happy Halloween! First of all, here's a random
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/space-donuts/6649567165235200">Space Donut</a> 
                fractal thingy. I made it because
                I was bored, and fractals are really
                awesome -- except I never saw donuts
                used instead of circles. :P <br>
                Also, here is another Khantober project: 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/flow-khantober/4802895315419136">Flow</a>.
                It's part of my attempt to relearn
                Natural Simulations.
                I used my Sketchpad for an art assignment, 
                as well. I drew the kitten from Kitbull,
                and added some code so that each stroke is
                drawn one at a time. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/kitbull/4779911661961216">Here it is.</a>
                Finally, here's a graphic -- <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/in-noctem-into-the-night/5366964820852736">In Noctem (Into
                the Night)</a>. 
                It was really fun to make, and I reckon it 
                turned out well.

                releasing projects is Tuesday. Here is my first

                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/lia-khantober-week-1/6485280581435392">Lia</a>! 
                One of my friends created Lia, and I think the
                graphic turned out well. Finally, here's another
                random experiment --

                Hello, hello, hello! So much has happened this
                week. I created two graphics for my art class,
                one with a 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/art-project/5920613557157888">fractal tree</a>
                and one called 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/the-window/4536459891392512">The Window,</a> 
                in which I discover a very nice texture.
                Also, I took a 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-a-new-type-of-fractal/6442537680977920">spin-off</a> 
                of a very cool project called "A New Type of
                Fractal" and experimented with strokeWeight,
                randomSeed, and bitwise operaters. I then (tried
                to) create a 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/zozo-coding-hackathon-challenge-1/5585961679142912">contest entry</a> for The Coding Hackathon, but it didn't turn
                out that great because I'm busy with school.
                And finally, last but not least, I learned that 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/anomalous-athletics-for-contest-sports/6322422372712448">my project</a>
                was one of the winners of Contest: Sports. I
                really wasn't expecting this because there were
                so many other great entries out there, but I'm 
                glad I got the opportunity to participate
                nonetheless. Some things I learned about: loading
                image algorithms, how to use mask with
                createGraphics, and how to abuse for loops to
                create amazing textures. Does anyone read these?

                It's midnight, and I just coded for myself a
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/chaos-game-sierpinskis-triangle/4578551391928320">chaos game program</a>. 
                Bear with me when I say
                that it randomly generates points that altogether
                look suspiciously like Sierpinski's Triangle.
                I've made too many programs with that thing,
                creating it by recursion two different ways, by
                a Lindenmayer system, and now  by a chaos game.
                However, this one is completely 101% made by me,
                so I'm happy. :D

                I want to experiment with all the different
                ways I can color it.
                I also took my L-System project and made
                a rainbow <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/gosper-curve-l-systems/6337713171939328">Gosper Curve</a>!
                A few days ago I started a Color by Number game
                as well.
                Plus, my project of me in flat art actually has
                inspired several other projects! That never

                My source was Daniel
                Shiffman's videos 2D Raycasting and Rendering
                Raycasting, but he did it in p5.js, so I had to
                change a lot of stuff. I made sure I understood
                every single detail. The idea of raycasting is
                actually pretty cool.

        <p>I've been programming on Khan Academy since June 2019,
           though I <em>really</em> started in March 2020.
           Other hobbies of mine, in no particular order, are
           reading, writing, practicing violin, practicing flute,            practicing kalimba, sewing, listening to music
           (classical, movie soundtracks), learning literally
           everything about mathematics, learning and helping on
           Khan Academy, painting and doodling, solving puzzles
           and riddles, having
           interesting/weird conversations with friends, 
           observing nature, ranting about the world,
           and thinking about Life, the Universe, and Everything
           until I descend into a cloud of frustration and don't
           know what anything is anymore. </p>
           
         <p>One day I aspire to be either a theoretical
            mathematician, musician, film scorer, composer,
            theoretical physicist-cosmologist-astronomer, 
            writer, programmer, or Khan Academy worker.
            Oh, and a sorcerer.
            What do you  <em>mean</em>  I must pick one? </p>
