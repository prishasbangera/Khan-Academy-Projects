Please note that the code may not be the cleanest or the most efficient, as I was just learning and having fun. :)


 ## Folders
  The folders listed below contain the copied code, but to run/view the projects, view the GitHub Page.
  Each project has code and (in the `ProjectREADME.md file`) name, link, description, and maybe an image and some notes/sources.

 - ### Tutorial Projects
 - Projects from following tutorials or when I was just starting out, especially the ones where I was experimenting and adding to the code.

 - ### Programming Art Projects
 - Smaller creative coding/art projects, including some inspired from my calculus classes.

 - ### Larger Projects
 - Larger art and non-art projects, including some contests.
 
 - ### SHOWCASE
