# Khan Academy Projects
 My favorite Khan Academy projects, starting from March 2020.

 !! IMPORTANT !! Descriptions are still under construction, and I may create a personal website later.

Please note that the code may not be the cleanest or the most efficient, as I was just learning and having fun. :)

Most code will be in Processing.js (deprecated), but there are also index.html files (p5.js, WebGL2, HTML/CSS, etc) and one Python file.


 ## Folders
  The folders listed below contain the copied code, but to run/view the projects, visit my KA profile. (Working on a GitHub Page!)
  Each project has code and (in the `ProjectREADME.md file`) name, link, description, and maybe an image and some notes/sources.

### Beginner and Tutorial Projects
 - Projects from following tutorials or when I was just starting out, especially the ones where I was experimenting and adding to the code.

### Math and Coding Projects
 - These are less related to art and more related to mathematics concepts or coding visualizations.

### Smaller Projects
 - Smaller creative coding/art or programming projects.
 - A few are me playing with more advanced tutorials, sources provided.

### Larger Programming Art Projects
 - Larger creative coding/art projects that didn't make it to the Showcase.
 
### SHOWCASE
 - Art and coding projects that I am proud of.
 - There is a subfolder of my raytracing/WEBGL/raymarching struggles. In the future, I will make a repo with my Shadertoy raymarching projects.
