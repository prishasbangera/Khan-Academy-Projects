# Khan Academy Projects
 My favorite Khan Academy projects, starting from March 2020. Includes projects in Processing.js as text files.

Please note that the code may not be the cleanest or the most efficient, as I was just learning and having fun. :)

Most code will be in Processing.js (deprecated), but there are also index.html files (p5.js, WebGL2, HTML/CSS, etc) and one Python file.


 ## Folders
  The folders listed below contain the copied code, but to run/view the projects, visit my KA profile. (Working on a GitHub Page!)
  Each project has code and (in the `ProjectREADME.md file`) name, link, description, and maybe an image and some notes/sources.

 - ### Tutorial Projects
 - Projects from following tutorials or when I was just starting out, especially the ones where I was experimenting and adding to the code.

 - ### Small Programming Art Projects
 - Smaller creative coding/art projects.

 - ### Larger Programming Art Projects
 - Larger creative coding/art projects that didn't make it to the Showcase.

 - ### Non-Art Projects
 - Some math/CS projects that aren't related to creative coding/art.
 
 - ### SHOWCASE
 - Art and coding projects that I am proud of.
